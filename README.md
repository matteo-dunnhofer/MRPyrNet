## Abstract
*This paper presents MRPyrNet, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that improves the capabilities of CNN-based pipelines for knee injury detection via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Existing works showed that anomalies are localized in small-sized knee regions that appear in particular areas of MRI scans. Based on such facts, MRPyrNet exploits a Feature Pyramid Network to enhance small appearing features and Pyramidal Detail Pooling to capture such relevant information in a robust way. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that MRPyrNet improves the ACL tear and meniscal tear diagnosis capabilities of two state-of-the-art methodologies. Code is available at https://git.io/JtMPH.*

## Installation

Code has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.7.1, scikit-learn==0.22.2.post1, and CUDA 10.

#### Clone the GIT repository.  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dontfollowmeimcrazy/MRPyrNet.git
```

#### Download the MRNet dataset. 
Download the official [MRNet dataset](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mrnet/) and put wherever you want in your local machine.
Then, set the path to the MRNet folder into the variable ```DATA_PATH``` contained in the bash files ```train_mrpyrnet.sh``` located in the folders ```MRNet+MRPyrNet``` and ```ELNet+MRPyrNet```.
   
## Train and Test

Run the following commands
```bash
cd MRNet+MRPyrNet
bash train_mrpyrnet.sh 
```  
to run an experiment with the MRPyrNet applied to the [MRNet pipeline](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002699). Brifely, This will train a MRNet+MRPyrNet instance for each view (axial, coronal, sagittal) for both the ACL and meniscus tear tasks. After, for each task, the script will train and test a logistic regressor combining the predictions of the three instances. Results, logs, and checkpoints for each experiment will be saved in the folder ```MRNet+MRPyrNet/experiments/```.

Run the following commands
```bash
cd ELNet+MRPyrNet
bash train_mrpyrnet.sh 
```  
to run an experiment with the MRPyrNet applied to the [ELNet pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02706). Brifely, This will train a single ELNet+MRPyrNet instance for the the ACL (axial view) and meniscus tear (coronal view) tasks. Results, logs, and checkpoints for each experiment will be saved in the folder ```ELNet+MRPyrNet/experiments/```.
